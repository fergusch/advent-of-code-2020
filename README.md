# Advent of Code 2020
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), written in Python.

My goal for each day is to solve the puzzle as quickly as possible, so my code isn't the prettiest or most efficient.

To run the code for a particular day:
```
cd 01 && python3 solution.py
```
