# Advent of Code Solutions
My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), written in Python.

My goal here is to solve each question as quickly as I can as well as learn new ways to use (and abuse) the Python language. Code will not necessarily be pretty or efficient.

Solutions are organized by year and then by question. Each folder contains my personal input (`input.txt`) and the code (`solution.py`) which will print out the solution to each part on a new line. Extra packages used are listed in `requirements.txt` for that year.
